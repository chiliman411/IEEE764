IEEE764
=======

Assignment 2
Use a programming language of your choice (i.e java) to write an application to convert decimal number to IEEE-754 Single Precision Floating-Point Representation (32-bit) and IEEE-754 Double Precision Floating-Point Representation (64-bit) and convert back to decimal. Use GUI as user interface asking the user for decimal number and the program will output the result.  
Specification
•	The IEEE-754 single precision floating point standard uses an 8-bit exponent (with a bias of 127) and a 23-bit significand.
•	The IEEE-754 double precision standard uses an 11-bit exponent (with a bias of 1023) and a 52-bit significand.
Requirements
•	Make your application runnable.
•	Demonstrate your application.
•	Submit your source code on gitub.com and copy and paste the link under assignment2 dropbox.
Extra credit
•	Android app or ios app  20%
•	Web application 10%
•	Applets 5%
•	Convert to Hexadecimal 5%
